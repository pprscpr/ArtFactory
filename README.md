This project was created during my studies at the STB-Berlin. The Project was divided in three groups frontend, backend and database adm. . I was responsible for the backend part in PHP and a few things in JS. The other parts were created and edited by Luis Ernesto Cabrera Garcia and Stefan Riedl.
The whole project simulates an artist-page where you can buy pictures as a customer and insert pictures in the role of an artist, in order to sell them.

The project was tested and works in a XAMPP.

-install xampp or similar

-insert the database from the database-folder via phpMyAdmin
  -at first : CreateTable_ArtFactory_V2.sql
  -then : Insert_Stilrichtungen.sql
  -then : Insert_Kontaktarten.sql
  -then : GRANTs_ArtFactory.sql
  -at last the three inser_files : 10 / 20 / 30_Inserts.sql

-copy the files into the ./htdocs folder

-run it in your browser via localhost/--foldername--
